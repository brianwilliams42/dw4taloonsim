# Taloon Chapter 3 Money Simulator

This project provides a Monte Carlo simulator for Taloon's money-making phases in
*Dragon Warrior IV* Chapter 3. The simulator models both the iron plate sales to
the Endor armor merchant and the subsequent shop phase with Neta.

## Features

- Configurable starting and target gold amounts.
- Support for multiple armor offer acceptance thresholds in a single run.
- Phase two modelling of purchase trips, sleeping nights, and probabilistic sales.
- Optional use of the further shop and an additional trip cutoff before sleeping.
- Sleep-night overrides that shorten rest when few items were delivered.
- Aggregated statistics and histogram buckets for each threshold.

## Usage

### Web interface

The web interface runs entirely in the browserâ€”no backend or custom server is
required. Open `index.html` from the repository (or deploy the contents to a
static host such as GitHub Pages) and configure simulations with the form
inputs. Results update inline, complete with aggregated metrics and the
histogram buckets for each armor threshold.

### Command-line interface

The CLI shares the exact simulation logic used by the web UI. It requires
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or newer.

Run the CLI directly with Node:

```bash
node cli.js --runs 500 --thresholds 1600,1700,1800 --use-far-shop
```

Use `--help` to see the full list of options, including overrides for starting
gold, target gold, sleep nights, optional reduced-sleep thresholds, the
additional trip cutoff, RNG seed, and histogram bucket sizing.

You can also install the executable locally:

```bash
npm install --global .
taloon-sim --runs 250 --thresholds 1570,1687
```

## Project structure

- `simulation.js`: Core Monte Carlo simulation logic shared by every interface.
- `defaults.js`: Default configuration and validation constraints.
- `app.js`: Browser UI wiring, form handling, and results presentation.
- `cli.js`: Node-based CLI that reuses the browser simulation module.
- `config.json`: Optional overrides for the browser UI (loaded when available).
- `index.html`, `styles.css`: Static assets for the browser experience.
